# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Version Support Policy

This document outlines the version support policy for our software project. It defines the support period for each software version, including the maintenance and end-of-life (EOL) phases. The goal of this policy is to provide clarity on the duration of support for each release and help users plan their updates accordingly.
Version Support Phases

Active Support (AS): During this phase, the latest stable version of the software receives regular updates, including bug fixes, security patches, and minor feature enhancements. The active support phase typically lasts for 6 months from the release date of the version.

Maintenance Support (MS): After the active support phase, the version transitions into the maintenance support phase. During this phase, the software continues to receive critical bug fixes and security patches, but new features are not added. The maintenance support phase also lasts for 6 months from the end of the active support phase.

End-of-Life (EOL): Once the maintenance support phase ends, the version reaches its end-of-life. No further updates or support will be provided for this version. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to a supported version to ensure continued security and stability.

| Version | Active Support     |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.0   | :white_check_mark: |


## Guidelines

1. Users are encouraged to use version 1.0.0 to benefit from the latest features, enhancements, and security updates.

2. During the active support phase, new features and enhancements will be considered based on user feedback and the project roadmap.

3. Security patches and critical bug fixes will be provided during both the active support and maintenance support phases.

4. Users are responsible for upgrading to a newer version before the end-of-life date of version 1.0.0.

5. After version 1.0.0 reaches its end-of-life, it will no longer receive updates or support.

This version support policy ensures that users have a clear understanding of the support timeline for version 1.0.0. We recommend users stay informed about updates and plan their upgrades accordingly to maintain a secure and stable environment.
